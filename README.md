###### Cate's algorithm:
Features:
- random uniform weights (not changed)
- discrete recombination (page 65)
- random resetting mutation (page 56)
- steady-state model (page 80): the best half of the population mate and the next generation will be half made by the parents, half made by the offspring (mutated) --> maybe it's a slow algorithm?

Possible changes or improvements:
- different distribution of the weights
- blend or arithmetic recombination
- nonuniform mutation
- different mating pool: generational model
